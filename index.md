Ethan graduated from Carthage College with BA's in Physics and Mathematics. He was part of the Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology program at CU Boulder pursuing a masters in Computer Science. His research interestes fall in complex biological systems, networks systems, and biostatistics. His research in the Vernerey group focused on discrete modeling of active networks and facillitated diffusion.

## Previous Research

#### Insect Aggregation Dynamics
Many insects displayed swarming behavior such as locusts, but very few are form aggregations like Honey Bees and Fire Ants. These structures display many interesting solid like behaviors which could be very informative to material science and robotics in the design of intellegent materials. The current work focuses on an exploration of the material properties of Fire Ant aggregations through experiments and simulations to further build active soft matter theory. 

#### 2-Dimension Facilitated Diffusion
Facillitated Diffusion is a facinating subject that is seen many places including the nuclear pore complex in cells. The facillitated diffusion in this context means preferentially letting molecules with binding sites pass through the area while excluding other undesired copounds. With the completion of a 1-dimensional model, the current work is in extending the theory into two dimensions coupled with verification from agent based simulations.
